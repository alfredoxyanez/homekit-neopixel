# homekit-neopixel

In this project we will create and program homekit compatible lights. We will be using a Raspberry P Zero W (I first prototypes with a RPi 3 B).

## Getting Started

We will use:
* [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
* [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)
* [Paho MQTT](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
* [Neo Pixels](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=neopixels)
* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
